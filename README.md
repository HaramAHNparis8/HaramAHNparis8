### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I am a Computer Science student. I have a strong interest in game development. I also like literature, traveling, and new experiences.


I am studying Computer Science and Game Engineering at the University of Paris 8 Vincennes-Saint-Denis.

interesting fact
I studied literature in South Korea and even won a literary award at a national competition during my high school years. I have a fondness for fairy tales and am very interested in game planning necessary for game development. Of course, I am equally interested in game production itself! I also enjoy exercising and have taken a body profile photo before.
